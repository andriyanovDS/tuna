### tuna

`tuna` is a command line tool designed to help efficiently view and analyze log files. With `tuna`, you can easily search for logs containing specific substrings, filter log sources, and easily navigate through large amounts of logs.

`tuna` utilizes a lazy parsing approach, meaning it processes logs only when required to display them on the screen.
